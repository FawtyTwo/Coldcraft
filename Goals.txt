First version (Cold):
-Temperature going up or down based on:
  Biome (Cold Biomes)
  Time of day
  Wearing armor or not
  Near furnace, fire, or torch
  Whether the player has armor or not
  Detect if the player is in shelter (if possible)
-Start to lose health when temperature hits zero, perhaps add witty death message.
-Try to add some kind of HUD to see temperature (maybe blue hearts)

Second version (Heat):
-Temperature going up or down based on:
  Biome (Hot Biomes)
  Time of day
  Wearing armor or not
  In water (Suspends heat going up?)
-Add "Comfort zone" of temperature between hot and cold, perhaps make HUD disappear.
-Add ability to consume water vials, or make new consumable that brings heat down.
-Start to loose health when temperature is at maximum

Third version:
-Add more stuff
-Take advice from people in forums?
